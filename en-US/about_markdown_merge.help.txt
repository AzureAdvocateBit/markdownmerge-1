TOPIC
   Markdown Merge

SHORT DESCRIPTION
   This module was inspired by the markdown-include npm module that allows you
   to include markdown files in other markdown files. This is great for when
   you are creating documents with a lot of common content.

LONG DESCRIPTION
   When using PlatyPS to generate help for your PowerShell module a lot of your
   markdown looks the same. I wanted to be able to write the common markdown
   once and simply include it in the other files before processing it with 
   PlatyPS to generate my *-Help.xml file for my module.

   The -InPath must exist. Only *.md files in the top level folder will be 
   processed. Any sub folders will be ignored. 

   The -OutPath folder will be created if it does not exist.  If it does exist
   any files in the folder with the same name of a final file will be
   overwritten.

   Files are read from -InPath and any include tags found are replaced by the
   contents of the file included.  Include tags are as follows. 

   <!-- #include "./common/header.md" -->

   Note the #include tag is inside a single line comment. This allows this to
   be ignored by any other markdown processing and prevents linters from
   logging warnings or errors.

EXAMPLES
   Merge-Markdown -InPath .\.docs -OutPath .\docs

   This will read all the files in .docs and process any include tags found.
   The final file with the same name will be written to the docs folder.
